"""
Contig Generation Problem: Generate the contigs from a collection of reads (with imperfect coverage).
contigs (long, contiguous segments of the genome) rather than entire chromosomes

The left part of the figure below shows four 10-mer reads that capture some but not all of the 
10-mers from an example genome. However, if we take the counterintuitive step of breaking these 
reads into shorter 5-mers (figure below, right), then these 5-mers exhibit perfect coverage. 
This read breaking approach, in which we break reads into shorter k-mers, is used by many modern 
assemblers.
Read breaking must deal with a practical trade-off. On the one hand, the smaller the value of k, 
the larger the chance that the k-mer coverage is perfect. On the other hand, smaller values of k 
result in a more tangled de Bruijn graph, making it difficult to infer the genome from this graph.

Input: A collection of k-mers Patterns.
Output: All contigs in DeBruijn(Patterns).
